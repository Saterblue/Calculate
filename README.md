# SetAndSubset
It's a kind of way to find the Subset from a Set
Such as a Set {a,b,c,d} it has 4 elements {a} {b} {c} {d}
The Subset is  all the probably about elements trus or false
So I think it's just like binary  {a} {b} {c} {d}
the binary ..............          0   0   0   0
the numbers of the subset not include null is 15 into the binary:  1111
So the binary 1-15 equals the true or false state about elements in the subset
